# VMware.LifecycleMatrix

A Powershell module to interact with the VMware Product Lifecycle Matrix website (<https://lifecycle.vmware.com>)

This module is not supported by VMware, and comes with no warranties express or implied. Please test and validate its functionality before using this product in a production environment.

## Installing VMware.LifecycleMatrix

### Powershell Gallery

VMware.LifecycleMatrix is available from the PowerShell Gallery. Run the following command in a PowerShell session to install the module:

```PowerShell
Install-Module VMware.LifecycleMatrix
```

### Manual Install

If for some reason, your system is unable to access PowerShell Gallery to install modules, you can install the module manually:

Open a PowerShell session and run the following command to find all the module installation paths on your system.

```PowerShell
$env:PSModulePath
```

Navigate to one of the paths returned from the command above, and create a new directory for the module

```PowerShell
New-Item VMware.LifecycleMatrix -ItemType Directory
```

Download the `.psd1` and `.psm1` files from <https://github.com/dcoghlan/VMware.LifecycleMatrix/tree/main/module> and save them to the directory created above.

## Loading the module

Once the VMware.LifecycleMatrix module is loaded onto your system, run the following command to import the module for use:

```PowerShell
Import-Module VMware.LifecycleMatrix
```

## What's Available

There are only a couple of cmdlets in this module. To view them all, run the following command:

```PowerShell
Get-Command -Module VMware.LifecycleMatrix
```

Each available cmdlet will return details and examples via the built-in Get-Help cmdlet.

```PowerShell
Get-Help Get-PLMProduct -Full
```
